# website-test.github.io

Welcome to the test website for [RL Economics](https://rlecon.github.io/website-test.github.io/).

You can clone this repo and add new content, and publish it by simply
pushing the changes into the online repo. This will automatically publish the
new html files in the website hosted by github.

To add content, create a new `.rst` file in the `source` folder, and add this
file to the `index.rst`. 

Then, navigate to the root folder and run `make html` to build.

For more details follow the offical [Getting started tutorial]
(https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html#defining-document-structure/>).
