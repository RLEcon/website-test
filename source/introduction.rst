Welcome to the test website for `RL Economics <https://rlecon.github.io/website-test.github.io/>`_.

To develop and publish new material for the website you will need to interact
with two different repos. 

One repo contains the source code, from which we generate the static html build
of the website via `sphinx-build`. 

The other repo stores the html files and other relevant files automatically
generated by `sphinx`.  
You can clone this repo and add new content, and publish it by simply
pushing the changes into the online repo. This will automatically publish the
material in the website hosted by github. 

To add content, create a new `.rst` file in the `source` folder, and add this
file to the `index.rst`. 

For more details follow the offical `Getting started tutorial
<https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html#defining-document-structure/>`_.
