In this document, I will discuss various empirical papers discussing
cyclicality of bid-ask spreads, liqudity in general, and its relationship with
stock trading volumne. The papers I am going to discuss are classics. These
are:

An Empirical Analysis of Stock and Bond Market Liquidity
--------------------------------------------------------

Liquidity Risk and Expected Stock Returns
-----------------------------------------
This is a very interesting and through paper. Stock market liquidity is
measures as the impact of order flow on stock returns. (I do not understand
what order flow is). This measurement is motivated by Camplbell's 1993 paper.
The authors find the the sensitivity of a stock to aggregate liquidity is a
pricing factors, and sensitive stocks require a larger compensation.
Empirically, liquidity is particularly low during bear markets, which is in
line with the empricial analysis of the paper below.

A CENTURY OF STOCK MARKET LIQUIDITY AND TRADING COSTS
-----------------------------------------------------
This paper analysis the relationship between the first and second moment of
liquiditiy and stock returns. Liqudity is measured as trading volumne (I need
to be more precisise). The authors find that the first and second momment of
liquidity are negatively related to excess returns. As excess returns are
countercylcical, low liquditiy occurs during times of recessions. I do not
understand how the volatility of liquidity should be related to excess returns.
