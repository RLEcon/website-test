In this document, I will discuss various empirical papers discussing
cyclicality of bid-ask spreads, liqudity in general, and its relationship with
stock trading volumne. The papers I am going to discuss are classics. These
are:

An Empirical Analysis of Stock and Bond Market Liquidity
--------------------------------------------------------

Liquidity Risk and Expected Stock Returns
-----------------------------------------
This is a very interesting and through paper. Stock market liquidity is
measures as the impact of order flow on stock returns. (I do not understand
what order flow is). This measurement is motivated by Camplbell's 1993 paper.
The authors find the the sensitivity of a stock to aggregate liquidity is a
pricing factors, and sensitive stocks require a larger compensation.
Empirically, liquidity is particularly low during bear markets, which is in
line with the empricial analysis of the paper below.

A Century OF Stock Market Liquidity and Trading Costs
-----------------------------------------------------
This paper analyses the predictive power of liquidity on annual expected stock
returns several yeards ahead. The author concludes that liquidity predicts
stock returns inversely:  High liquidity leads to low stock returns and vice
versa. Liquidity is measured as the aggregate bid-ask spready normalized by
stock prices. The dataset spans 1900-2000, and bid-ask spreads are construed
from various sources. Since 1993, bid-ask spreads seem to be of high quality
and are provided by the ``Trades and Quotes`` (TAQ) database provided by the
NYSE. Whilst I like the paper due to its simplicity and long dataset, I am not
entirely convinced by the findings of the paper. The authors normalize spread
by the stock price, and thanks for Shillers work we know that low
dividend-price ratios are one of the best predictors of low future stock
returns. Nevertheless, one of the regressions of the author does control for
the dividend-price ratio and the predictive power of normalized bid-ask spread
is preserved.
